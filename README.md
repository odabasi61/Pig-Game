This is a two-player dice game. The rules:
- Player1 throw the dice. It could return between 1 and 6.
- If the dice returns any numbers other than 1, than these numbers are added to the players current score.
- If the dice returns 1, than the player loses all the points he/she eraned till that point. And player2 throw the dice. The same rules apply for the player2.
- If the players do not want to risk their points, thay can press hold button and by doing this, they save their points but the throwing turn is other player's now.
- Whichever player reaches 100 or more points first, he/she wins the game.
